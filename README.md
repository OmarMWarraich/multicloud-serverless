# Learn Multicloud Serverless Application Development in Baby Steps
Learn Multicloud Serverless Application Development using AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and other best of the breed serverless technologies in baby steps. 

[Multicloud: Everything you need to know about the biggest trend in cloud computing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/multicloud-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-biggest-trend-in-cloud-computing/).

To get started with serverless first find out [what is serverless by watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkD53Uuz4Rk). Then read this [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing).

We will focus more on [bringing together and learning two great technologies: serverless and containers](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/serverless-and-containers-two-great-technologies-that-work-great-together/).

We will learn how to integrate different serverless cloud services, SaaS, and legacy applications using [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub), [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-grid/), and [Cloud Events](https://cloudevents.io/). We will be do [multicloud messaging with the help of serverless functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY0cHfDhpF4)

We will use infrastructure as code to provision serverless services in any cloud with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Our NoSQL database of choice will be [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), for SQL database we will use [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) and [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) for low latency access to app data and native QraphQL support.

For serverless containers we will use [Gooogle Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) and [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) for serverless functions.

For automating our workflows and CI/CD we will be using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

We will using Typescript and Rust as our development language of choice. You may learn Typescript from [this Panacloud repo](https://github.com/panacloud/learn-typescript) and Rust from [this book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

For microservices development we will be using Express with Typescript which you can learn from [this Panacloud repo](https://github.com/panacloud/learn-typed-express). For microservices development which is computation heavy and performance is critical we will use [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper).

For front-end development we will use JAMstack, React, Gatsby.js, and WebAssembly. You can get started learning these technologies from [Panacloud Bootcamp 2020](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2020/).

We will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our code editor.

Note: If you don't have any programming background we suggest that you start with [Panacloud Bootcamp 2020](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2020/).
